# elsa
An electronic store GUI that allows you to add customers, peripherals, and desktops to place an order that you can then view and see the final order. This program allows you to save your store and open it back up later. Comes with an Easter Egg section of fictional characters to test with and an about page with credits. Fully coded in C++ and comes with a MakeFile. All testing for this has been done in a Linux shell and sprint 4 is the LATEST version of the code.
If you would like to run the code without looking at the makefile:
to build:
make elsa
to run:
./elsa
to clear the build:
make clean
